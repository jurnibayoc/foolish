      DEC 1, 2020: Libra: There's really no need to be in such a hurry to prove yourself. The more patient you are, the happier you'll be when you finally get your turn. The stars urge you to win your victories one at a time, face-to-face and to be fully aware of your actions. As the hours wear on, the increasing influence of certain astral aspects lead you to the politics of charm. A romantic issue is beautifully resolved tonight without a lot of effort from either party... from astrology.com.

      DEC 1, 2020: Gemini: You're one of the first people chosen for the team. All day long it seems that you're somehow on the right side of the line that separates insiders from outsiders. Don't be afraid to ask for something that you didn't think was possible yesterday. It's still possible to get in on the ground floor of a new venture if you know how to work it. Later in the day someone could share a recent experience with those who can benefit from the tale... from astrology.com.

      DEC 1, 2020: Virgo: If you can't do it yourself, maybe you shouldn't attempt to do it at all. Support may be forthcoming, but it's on someone else's schedule. In the hours that it takes to wait and explain, you could probably handle matters on your own. Organization is the key to your success. Making sure everything is in its place before you start will save endless time in the long run. Proving this to yourself now is money in the bank for next time... from astrology.com.

      DEC 1, 2020: Scorpio: Keep one eye on the bottom line at all times. Your strength and determination won't let you fail. When you're finished, no one else can claim this victory but you. You need your alone time, and that's a good thing because solitude is on the agenda. Do what you must because the energy you're giving off is too powerful for most. Your cause may catch fire as it picks up speed further down the road, but for now you struggle with the concept of anonymity... from astrology.com.

      DEC 1, 2020: Pisces: What happened? You got off to such a great start, but you're suddenly feeling tired. Don't be surprised if your huge lead slows back down to a walking pace. Now that you've had your fun, another person gets a chance. Crossing the finish line is what's important, not finishing first. The promise that you made to yourself is still good. You just don't have the energy to be "on" all the time. You should be proud of your effort... from astrology.com.
